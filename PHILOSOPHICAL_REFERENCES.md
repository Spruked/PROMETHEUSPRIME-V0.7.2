# Why Philosophical References Belong in the Core & Modules

## Symbolic Authority
Each module (EchoStack, DoubleHelix, Gyroscopic Harmonizer, etc.) is built around a philosophical principle:

- **EchoStack** ← Hume, Spinoza
- **DoubleHelix** ← Kant, Locke
- **Harmonizer** ← Aristotelian balance + composite judgment
- **Vaults** ← Memory theory from modern cognitive science + moral theology

These must be cited in the modules to preserve transparency and traceability of CALI’s reasoning.

## Self-Awareness + Explainability
CALI’s ability to explain why she made a choice relies on internally mapped philosopher-hooks. Without these references:

- Her logic becomes ungrounded
- She can't refer to guiding axioms
- The output lacks interpretability

## The Seed Vault Already Relies on Them
The seed vault injects Confucius, Kant, Nietzsche, Taleb, Gladwell, etc. — but if these are never mirrored in core.py files, the symbolic system collapses in higher-order reasoning.
