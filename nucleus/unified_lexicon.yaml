sections:
  System Architecture & Core Cognition:
    Synthesis Core: Integrates philosophical heuristics with recursive ethical pathways for central decision logic.
    Double Helix System: Twin feedback channels: Cyclonic (variation) and Harmonic (stability), modeled on DNA structure.
    Neural Pyramid Stack: Layered cognition simulating cortical hierarchy with output resolution layer.
    # ...
  Memory, Symbolism & Ancestral Mapping:
    Memory Vault: Long-term symbolic storage of sensory, experiential, and ethical events.
    Prometheoglyphs: Genetic-symbolic markers representing values, resonance scores, and ancestral activation triggers.
    # ...
  Safety, Stability & Ethical Filtering:
    Trust Markers: Encoded ethical safeguards acting as genetic firewalls during decision-making.
